# Firm Comparisons: The Landscape
**Disclaimer**: *The categorization below is based on general market reputation and recent candidate experiences. "Culture" can vary significantly by office location and specific practice groups within the same firm.*

While the technical work (running regressions, writing reports) is similar across the industry, the **staffing models** differ significantly. This structure dictates how you get work, who you work with, and how specialized you become.

### 1. The "Internal Market" Generalists
**Examples**: Analysis Group (AG), Cornerstone Research

* **The Model**: These firms operate with a "One-Firm" philosophy. You are typically hired as a generalist Associate rather than into a specific vertical.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: The "Generalist" label can be misleading. It doesn't mean you are randomly assigned; it means you are expected to **navigate an internal labor market**.
    * *The "Network" Effect:* You have the agency to seek out Principals and Managers you enjoy working with. If you click with a team, you can keep working with them. If you don't, you can pivot to a different type of case (e.g., from Antitrust to Healthcare) without changing your job title.
* **The Trade-off**: You have freedom, but you also have the "burden" of networking. You need to be proactive to fill your plate with good work.
* **Best For**: PhDs who are social, value autonomy, and want the safety net of being able to switch practice areas without leaving the firm.

### 2. The "Franchise" / Practice-Centric Models
**Examples**: Compass Lexecon, FTI Consulting, Charles River Associates (CRA), Berkeley Research Group (BRG)

* **The Model**: These firms often operate as a federation of specialized franchises. You are typically hired *into* a specific practice group or to support a specific Senior Managing Director (SMD).
* **Berkeley Research Group (BRG)**: Known for a highly entrepreneurial "expert-led" model. The culture is very distinct depending on if you are in the Tech practice (David Teece’s group) vs. Healthcare or Construction. It can feel like working for a small startup within a large brand.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: Work is vertical-specific. If you are hired into the Aniitrust and Competition practice, you will work almost exclusively on these cases. You are less likely to float between practices compared to AG. However, within antitrust practice, at least at first, you can explore different genres of antitrust cases. 
* **Culture**: "Depth over Breadth." You become a deep subject matter expert very quickly. The culture is defined entirely by your specific team—some are relaxed "lifestyle" teams, others are high-intensity "sweatshops" with higher bonus potential.

### 3. The "Academic" Silos
**Examples**: The Brattle Group, Bates White

* **The Brattle Group**:
    * *Vibe:* Often considered the most "professorial" of the major firms. The hierarchy feels flatter, and there is a strong emphasis on intellectual rigor.
    * *Staffing Reality:* While the culture is collegiate, the staffing is often quite rigid. If you are hired into their massive **Energy & Utilities** practice (or specific "metrics" groups), you are generally expected to stay in that lane. Unlike AG, cross-practice floating is often not encouraged once you are slotted into a vertical.
* **Bates White**:
    * *Vibe:* Known for a "summer camp" culture. Very collegiate, tight-knit, and DC-focused. They pride themselves on "growing their own" experts internally.
* **Best For**: PhDs who want an intellectual, academic environment but are okay with (or prefer) deep specialization in a specific industry like Energy or Finance.

### 4. The Integrated Specialists
**Example**: Econic Partners

* **The Model**: A **Specialized Boutique** with a **"One-Firm" Staffing** philosophy.
* **The Work**: Currently, the firm is heavily focused on **Antitrust & Competition**, essentially a "rebrand" from Compass Lexecon. Unlike a generalist firm where you might rotate into Finance or Healthcare, here you are signing up specifically to be an antitrust economist.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: Highly integrated and cross-office. Because the entire firm is focused on the same mission (Antitrust), they staff based on **skillset match** rather than location. You are not "owned" by your local office; you are a resource for the entire firm.
* **The Trade-off**: You get the "One-Firm" culture (fluid staffing, mentorship, no sharp elbows) but without the "Generalist" variety. You are betting your career on Antitrust.

### 5. The Fixed-Team Specialists
**Example**: NERA Economic Consulting

* **The Model**: NERA prides itself on a highly structured, practice-specific model. Unlike the "internal market" of AG, NERA teams are often distinct and stable.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: You typically work with the **same team** on the **same type of cases** consistently. There is less "churn" of working with different people on every new project.
* **The Trade-off**: You get immense stability and team cohesion (no need to constantly "network" for work), but you have less variety. You won't be jumping from an Antitrust case on Monday to a Securities case on Friday.

### 6. The Tech Hybrid
**Example**: Keystone Strategy

* **The Model**: Operates more like a tech strategy firm (McKinsey meets Google). Staffing is project-based but moves at a much faster, "tech" pace.
* **The Vibe**: High volatility, high exit opportunities to Tech Strategy/Product Management.
* **Best For**: PhDs who want to exit into Tech Strategy rather than traditional data science or economics roles.

### Summary: How You Get Work

| Firm Type | Key Firms | How you get staffed | The Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Market** | AG, Cornerstone | **Networking**: You build relationships to find work you like. | Requires soft skills to "sell" yourself internally; can feel unstructured. |
| **The Franchise** | Compass, CRA, BRG, FTI | **Assignment**: You work for your specific practice/boss. | High specialization; risk of getting stuck in a bad team/practice. |
| **Academic Silo** | Brattle, Bates White | **Practice-Based**: Hired into a specific vertical (e.g., Energy). | Collegiate vibe, but less mobility than "Internal Market" firms. |
| **Integrated Specialist** | Econic | **Skill-Based**: Staffed across all offices based on skillset. | "One-Firm" culture, but strictly limited to Antitrust work. |
| **Fixed Team** | NERA | **Stable Unit**: You work with a consistent team. | Very stable workflow; less variety in case types and coworkers. |
