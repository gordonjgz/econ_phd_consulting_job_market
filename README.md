### Disclaimer: 
> This document is for sharing tips and experiences for the job market, specifically for econ consulting. The goal is to provide additional information for PhDs on the job market seeking full-time positions in the econ/litigation consulting industry. Econ consulting jobs (and private sector jobs in general) are usually less discussed among the advisors/professors for econ PhDs. Even if your advisor is supportive, they might know all the details between firms and how to successfully interview with econ consulting firms.

## What is Econ Consulting?
Econ consulting or litigation consulting is a niche industry that mainly works for law firms to help lawyers to analyze their cases. Most likely, the cases involved a legal dispute over the damage that occurred to one of the parties. Largely, econ consulting can be divided into these practices: 1. antitrust and competition, 2. finance, 3. health care specific cases, and 4. energy and regulatory specific cases. Economists with an econ PhD are capable of economic modeling, data pipeline, (sometimes) working with academia professors, counterfactual analysis, as well as expressing complicated economic ideas, which is why many firms hire econ PhD for their Associate (or Economist, Senior Associate, Senior Economists. Different firms have different titles regarding their PhD-level employees.) Associates are hired with the expectation to grow into Partner/Principal (the project manager who will be leading the case and attracting more clients and cases, and sometimes testifying for cases themselves). 

#### Why does Econ Consulting need PhDs (and specifically from high-ranking programs)?
Due to the reason that Associates are expected to grow into future principals, or even testifying experts, econ consulting firms value the "prestige" of your PhD program. For example, if an expert with a Harvard econ PhD degree testifies behind a lawyer, the judge/jury will feel safer to believe this expert. Even if the Associate does not plan to grow into a testifying expert, a principal with a more prestigious program is easier to attract more clients and to attract external experts in academia. 

With that being said, it's certainly not the case that econ consulting only hires Tier 1 PhD programs. Thinking more in this way, if academic jobs are very much like a "caste" system, where an AP vacancy in Tier 1 to Tier 1.5 is almost certainly going to a Tier 1 program, and in tech jobs, the ranking of your program does not matter at all, econ consulting is more in the middle where the ranking matters a little bit, but you can certainly make up for it with your research quality, presentation skills, and interview skills. 

Another reason econ consulting will value higher-ranking programs is that firing in econ consulting is less common compared to the tech industry (and probably more compared to academia). For low performing Assocaites, the firm will usually use attrition rather than straight-up firing you, meaning no promotion, a low bonus, and keeping your hours high. This slight risk aversion makes the recruitment cycle in econ consulting firms quite selective. However, this varies quite largely between firms, e.g., Keystone operates more like a tech company and will not hesitate to fire you if you are not contributing. 

## Econ Consulting Job Market Overview
> By going through past initial placement results for job market candidates from all top 30ish econ departments from 2020 to 2025, I used Gemini to help me compile a result to see which econ consulting firms tend to recruit more PhD students. This list is certainly not exhaustive and only contain the subset of econ consulting firms. I also include some tech companies as well. I used the "deep research" function of Gemini instead of going through all the websites one by one. Therefore, please take this result with a large grain of salt and only treat it as a qualitative comparison.

## Econ Consulting PhD-level Interview Tips
The interviews for econ consulting are quite uniform and are very similar to the style of academia interviews. I detailed the interview tips in [Econ Consulting Interview Tips](https://github.com/gordonjgz/econ_phd_consulting_job_market/blob/main/Econ_Consulting_Interview.md).
