# Firm Comparisons: The Landscape
**Disclaimer**: *The categorization below is based on general market reputation and recent candidate experiences. "Culture" can vary significantly by office location and specific practice groups within the same firm.*

While the technical work (running regressions, writing reports) is similar across the industry, the **staffing models** differ significantly. This structure dictates how you get work, who you work with, and how specialized you become.

### 1. The "Internal Market" Generalists
**Examples**: Analysis Group (AG), Cornerstone Research

* **The Model**: These firms operate with a "One-Firm" philosophy. You are typically hired as a generalist Associate rather than into a specific vertical.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: The "Generalist" label can be misleading. It doesn't mean you are randomly assigned; it means you are expected to **navigate an internal labor market**.
    * *The "Network" Effect:* You have the agency to seek out Principals and Managers you enjoy working with. If you click with a team, you can keep working with them. If you don't, you can pivot to a different type of case (e.g., from Antitrust to Healthcare) without changing your job title.
* **The Trade-off**: You have freedom, but you also have the "burden" of networking. You need to be proactive to fill your plate with good work.
* **Best For**: PhDs who are social, value autonomy, and want the safety net of being able to switch practice areas without leaving the firm.

### 2. The "Silo" / Franchise Models
**Examples**: Compass Lexecon, FTI Consulting, Charles River Associates (CRA), Berkeley Research Group (BRG)

* **The Model**: These firms often operate as a federation of specialized franchises. You are typically hired *into* a specific practice group or to support a specific Senior Managing Director (SMD).
* **Berkeley Research Group (BRG)**: Known for a highly entrepreneurial "expert-led" model. The culture is very distinct depending on if you are in the Tech practice (David Teece’s group) vs. Healthcare or Construction. It can feel like working for a small startup within a large brand.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: Work is vertical-specific. If you are hired into the Merger practice, you will work almost exclusively on merger cases. You are less likely to float between groups compared to AG.
* **Culture**: "Depth over Breadth." You become a deep subject matter expert very quickly. The culture is defined entirely by your specific team—some are relaxed "lifestyle" teams, others are high-intensity "sweatshops" with higher bonus potential.

### 3. The "Academic" Silos
**Examples**: The Brattle Group, Bates White

* **The Brattle Group**:
    * *Vibe:* Often considered the most "professorial" of the major firms. The hierarchy feels flatter, and there is a strong emphasis on intellectual rigor.
    * *Staffing Reality:* While the culture is collegiate, the staffing is often quite rigid. If you are hired into their massive **Energy & Utilities** practice (or specific "metrics" groups), you are generally expected to stay in that lane. Unlike AG, cross-practice floating is often not encouraged once you are slotted into a vertical.
* **Bates White**:
    * *Vibe:* Known for a "summer camp" culture. Very collegiate, tight-knit, and DC-focused. They pride themselves on "growing their own" experts internally.
* **Best For**: PhDs who want an intellectual, academic environment but are okay with (or prefer) deep specialization in a specific industry like Energy or Finance.

### 4. The Fixed-Team Specialists
**Example**: NERA Economic Consulting

* **The Model**: NERA prides itself on a highly structured, practice-specific model. Unlike the "internal market" of AG, NERA teams are often distinct and stable.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: You typically work with the **same team** on the **same type of cases** consistently. There is less "churn" of working with different people on every new project.
* **The Trade-off**: You get immense stability and team cohesion (no need to constantly "network" for work), but you have less variety. You won't be jumping from an Antitrust case on Monday to a Securities case on Friday.
* **Best For**: PhDs who prefer stability and consistency—knowing exactly who they will work with every day and what kind of problems they will solve.

### 5. The Tech Hybrids & New Entrants
**Examples**: Keystone Strategy, Econic Partners

* **Keystone**: Operates more like a tech strategy firm (McKinsey meets Google). Staffing is project-based but moves at a much faster, "tech" pace. High volatility, high exit opportunities to Tech Strategy.
* **Econic**: A new entrant focused on high-stakes antitrust. Likely offers a "start-up" equity component or high compensation variance, with a focus on building a new elite team from the ground up.

### Summary: How You Get Work

| Firm Type | Key Firms | How you get staffed | The Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Market** | AG, Cornerstone | **Networking**: You build relationships to find work you like. | Requires soft skills to "sell" yourself internally; can feel unstructured. |
| **The Silo** | Compass, CRA, BRG, FTI | **Assignment**: You work for your specific practice/boss. | High specialization; risk of getting stuck in a bad team/practice. |
| **Academic Silo** | Brattle | **Practice-Based**: Hired into a specific vertical (e.g., Energy). | Collegiate vibe, but less mobility than "Internal Market" firms. |
| **Fixed Team** | NERA | **Stable Unit**: You work with a consistent team. | Very stable workflow; less variety in case types and coworkers. |
