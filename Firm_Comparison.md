# Firm Comparisons: The Landscape
**Disclaimer**: *The categorization below is based on general market reputation and recent candidate experiences. "Culture" can vary significantly by office location and specific practice groups within the same firm.*

While the technical work (running regressions, writing reports) is similar across the industry, the **staffing models** differ significantly. This structure dictates how you get work, who you work with, and how specialized you become.

### 1. The "Open Market" Generalists
**Examples**: Analysis Group (AG), Cornerstone Research

* **The Model**: These firms operate with a "One-Firm" philosophy. You are typically hired as a generalist Associate rather than into a specific vertical.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: You are encouraged—and expected—to **navigate an internal labor market**.
    * *The "Network" Effect:* You have the agency to seek out Principals and Managers you enjoy working with. If you click with a team, you can keep working with them. If you don't, you can pivot to a different type of case (e.g., from Antitrust to Healthcare) without changing your job title.
* **Culture**: Highly collaborative and flexible. You curate your own experience over time.
* **Best For**: PhDs who value autonomy over their coworkers and want the safety net of being able to switch practice areas without leaving the firm.

### 2. The "Silo" / Practice-Centric Models
**Examples**: Compass Lexecon, FTI Consulting, Charles River Associates (CRA), Berkeley Research Group (BRG)

* **The Model**: These firms often operate as a federation of specialized franchises. You are typically hired *into* a specific practice group or to support a specific Senior Managing Director (SMD).
* **Berkeley Research Group (BRG)**: Known for a highly entrepreneurial "expert-led" model. The culture is very distinct depending on if you are in the Tech practice (David Teece’s group) vs. Healthcare or Construction. It can feel like working for a small startup within a large brand.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: Work is vertical-specific. If you are hired into the Merger practice, you will work almost exclusively on merger cases. You are less likely to float between groups compared to AG.
* **Culture**: "Depth over Breadth." You become a deep subject matter expert very quickly. The culture is defined entirely by your specific team—some are relaxed "lifestyle" teams, others are high-intensity "sweatshops" with higher bonus potential.
* **Best For**: PhDs who know exactly what they want to do (e.g., "I want to be an Antitrust IO economist") and want to work with specific famous experts in that field.

### 3. The "Academic Cooperatives"
**Examples**: The Brattle Group, Bates White

* **The Model**: These firms sit somewhere between the corporate scale of AG and the rigid silos of Compass. They are famous for maintaining a "university department" vibe.
* **The Brattle Group**:
    * *Vibe:* Often considered the most "professorial" of the major firms. The hierarchy feels flatter, and there is a strong emphasis on intellectual rigor over commercial aggression.
    * *Staffing:* They use a "Principal-driven" model where you have a mentor, but the culture encourages collaboration across their massive Energy and Finance practices. It is less "sharky" than the franchise models.
* **Bates White**:
    * *Vibe:* Known for a "summer camp" culture. Very collegiate, tight-knit, and DC-focused. They pride themselves on "growing their own" experts internally.
* **Best For**: PhDs who miss the intellectual camaraderie of grad school and want a polite, rigorous environment (often with a strong focus on Energy, Utilities, or Finance).

### 4. The Fixed-Team Specialists
**Example**: NERA Economic Consulting

* **The Model**: NERA prides itself on a highly structured, practice-specific model. Unlike the "open market" of AG, NERA teams are often distinct and stable.
* **Staffing Dynamics**: You typically work with the **same team** on the **same type of cases** consistently. There is less "churn" of working with different people on every new project.
* **Culture**: Traditional and academic. Because you work with the same group repeatedly, the environment can feel very "departmental," similar to a university faculty where you stick to your field.
* **Best For**: PhDs who prefer stability and consistency—knowing exactly who they will work with every day and what kind of problems they will solve (e.g., Securities, Transfer Pricing).

### 5. The Tech Hybrids & New Entrants
**Examples**: Keystone Strategy, Econic Partners

* **Keystone**: Operates more like a tech strategy firm (McKinsey meets Google). Staffing is project-based but moves at a much faster, "tech" pace. High volatility, high exit opportunities to Tech Strategy.
* **Econic**: A new entrant focused on high-stakes antitrust. Likely offers a "start-up" equity component or high compensation variance, with a focus on building a new elite team from the ground up.

### Summary: How You Get Work

| Firm Type | Key Firms | How you get staffed | The Trade-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open Market** | AG, Cornerstone | **Networking**: You build relationships to find work you like. | Requires soft skills to "sell" yourself internally; can feel unstructured. |
| **The Silo** | Compass, CRA, BRG, FTI | **Assignment**: You work for your specific practice/boss. | High specialization; risk of getting stuck in a bad team/practice. |
| **Academic Co-op** | Brattle, Bates White | **Mentorship**: Strong principal-associate pairing with collaboration. | Slower pace than silos, but less autonomy than open market. |
| **Fixed Team** | NERA | **Stable Unit**: You work with a consistent team. | Very stable workflow; less variety in case types and coworkers. |
