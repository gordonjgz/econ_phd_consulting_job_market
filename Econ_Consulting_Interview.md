This document is to share some tips for econ consulting interviews, specifically for Econ PhD students applying for Associate level positions. Noted that the interview format between firms is largely uniform, and quite similar to academia job market interviews. The interview process will be 2-3 rounds: 1. HR screening (most firms do not have this round), 2. Virtual/In-person interview with 1-2 of the consultants, 3. Fly out. I will discuss the tips for each step, as well as how to secure interviews. 

### 0. How to secure Interviews?
This is, I believe, the hardest part to gauge, as HR rarely discloses what they are looking for specifically; however, I think the following factors generally play a role (I will try to rank them in order of importance in my opinion, but as I said, this is my assumption as well):

1. Your interests in the consulting industry. What consulting firms do not want is to hire some job market candidates who use consulting as a fallback option if the academic job market does not go well. You do not need to believe this is the best job in the world, but you need to showcase some general curiosity about what they do. You can also use opportunities like attending a virtual info session, tailoring a CV for consulting (try to do a little bit "resume" style format), talking to alumni who are currently working in the consulting industry to learn more about the industry, and writing a non-generic cover letter to highlight your interests. Past experiences in consulting, like summer internships and pre-PhD work experiences, will be your huge assets.
2. Your letter writer (not just your main advisor). If at least one of your letter writers is a well-known name in the consulting world, i.e., works with consultants a lot as an external expert, then you will very much have an advantage.
3. Teaching experiences. One of the most important jobs as a consultant is to explain things to non-technical audiences, as well as explain economics to junior analysts who do not have a PhD. Candidates with teaching experience (not just TA) will have an advantage.
4. Demonstrated experience in mentoring students. Consultants will be managing analysts for specific workstreams, and part of the very important firm culture is mentorship.
5. The content of your JMP. Compared to academia, the strength and content of your JMP is very important. e.g., if your JMP is related to the housing market, some economics department who specific is looking for a housing economist will find your profile very attractive. On the other hand, consulting is more interested in the way you think, the interesting econometric method/modeling you used, and how you explain your JMP. With that being said, if a certain consulting company has a concentration of cases with a specific industry, and your JMP happens to be in this industry, then you certainly will have an edge. However, this is so hard to plan (and know this kind of information),and I generally don't think it's worth planning. In addition, if your JMP heavily cites one of their affiliated external expert, then you will likely have an advantage.
6. The prestigeness of your program.
7. Your field. Nowadays, consulting hires from all kinds of fields, ranging from economic history to macro. The edge for being an IO economist, in my opinion is very small.

### 1. HR screening. 
Most firms do not do HR screening. But if they do, be sure to treat it as a formal interview to demonstrate your technical skills, and most importantly, your explaining skills. If HR, a person who do not have econ background, can mostly understand the gist of your JMP, then they will be confident in your presentation skills. 

HR, in many cases, will help you with tips for further round interviews, and be sure to write them down; many HR will try to sell their firms, and these are good talking points in the future rounds. 

Most importantly, don't disclose any red flags to HR. For example, if you had an internship and are still on the market looking for full-time jobs, regardless of the reason, it is generally not a good idea to disclose to HR that you did not receive the return offer. 

### 2. First round interview
For most cases, first round interviews will be virtual. However, TEC in NABE ([TEC 2025](https://www.nabe.com/NABE/NABE/Events/TEC25/TEC2025.aspx)) hosts in-person interviews for some consulting firms. Think of it as a replacement for the annual AEA meeting for the private sectors, since as of 2025-2026, the annual AEA meeting does not host in person interviews any more. 

First round interviews for most firms are behavioral + talking about your research (more likely your JMP). If this is the format, I will recommend doing the following:

1. Prepare different versions of your JMP spiel. Elevator pitch, 30s, 1 min, 2 min. Really depends on the format, time constraints, and how many interviewers. You don't need to show everything at once, and likely you can't show your JMP altogether. Leave some room for questions.
2. Consultants are very smart economists, so be ready for grilling on any parts of your JMP, from your data to the assumptions you made, as well as your econometric methods. Be candid about your shortcomings.
3. For behavior questions, be ready to answer: Why consulting? Why not academic or tech? Have you applied for academia or tech (you should be honest, say yes, but my priority is consulting)
4. For "Tell me about yourself". Craft multiple versions of your story depending on time constraints and audience. Tell it like a story. Mention relevant experiences or achievements that couldn’t fit on your resume but could help you stand out. Take time to refine your answer. It’s worth it and could make you memorable.
5. Sometimes the consultant will ask you to explain jargon, e.g., explain Maximum Likelihood Estimation to people who don't study economics, or explain IV to a non-technical audience.
6. Other interesting questions I got asked: Why did you choose your field? What are your general research interests and why? How did you choose your advisor? I got someone asking me, why do you want to be an econ PhD student?

In the end, be sure to prepare some questions to ask them. Good questions include firm culture, staffing model, or anything that showcases your curiosity in the industry. After the interview, be sure to write thank-you notes to your interviewers. If they take time to respond to your thank-you notes, it's an indication of a good sign. 

Few and few companies are still using case interviews as a first round interview format. For case interviews, I will recommend doing the following:

1. Review consulting websites for case examples to familiarize yourself.
2. Explore guidelines like the DOJ Merger Guidelines or skim books like the Handbook of Antitrust to understand how consultants think and approach problems. Focus less on the jargons, but more on the structure of thinking.
3. When answering case study questions, use a step-by-step approach, starting with a simple explanation. Be sure to explain the economics and the big picture instead of falling into the weeds of model/data. E.g., the goal here is to prove that A causes B, we will be looking for data C, D, and E, with endogeneity concerns, we can look for certain IV, instead of focusing too much on the details of is data C is available, how should we process these.
4. Sometimes you will be asked to argue against yourself; be prepared for that. For example, if you are first asked to argue for the plaintiff, the interviewer might ask you to switch sides and argue for the defendants. Don't argue against yourself.
5. Don't be controlled by your prior, and be fair to both sides. 
6. Use AI as a good mock interview tool for case interviews.
