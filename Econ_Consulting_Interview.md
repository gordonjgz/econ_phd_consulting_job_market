This document is to share some tips for econ consulting interviews, specifically for Econ PhD students applying for Associate level positions. Noted that the interview format between firms is largely uniform, and quite similar to academia job market interviews. The interview process will be 2-3 rounds: 1. HR screening (most firms do not have this round), 2. Virtual/In-person interview with 1-2 of the consultants, 3. Fly out. I will discuss the tips for each step, as well as how to secure interviews. 

### 0. How to secure Interviews?
This is, I believe, the hardest part to gauge, as HR rarely discloses what they are looking for specifically; however, I think the following factors generally play a role (I will try to rank them in order of importance in my opinion, but as I said, this is my assumption as well):

1. Your interests in the consulting industry. What consulting firms do not want is to hire some job market candidates who use consulting as a fallback option if the academic job market does not go well. You do not need to believe this is the best job in the world, but you need to showcase some general curiosity about what they do. You can also use opportunities like attending a virtual info session, tailoring a CV for consulting (which I will explain in more detail down below), talking to alumni who are currently working in the consulting industry to learn more about the industry, and writing a non-generic cover letter to highlight your interests. Past experiences in consulting, like summer internships and pre-PhD work experiences, will be your huge assets.
2. Your letter writer (not just your main advisor). If at least one of your letter writers is a well-known name in the consulting world, i.e., works with consultants a lot as an external expert, then you will very much have an advantage.
3. Teaching experiences. One of the most important jobs as a consultant is to explain things to non-technical audiences, as well as explain economics to junior analysts who do not have a PhD. Candidates with teaching experience (not just TA) will have an advantage.
4. Demonstrated experience in mentoring students. Consultants will be managing analysts for specific workstreams, and part of the very important firm culture is mentorship.
5. The content of your JMP. Compared to academia, the strength and content of your JMP is very important. e.g., if your JMP is related to the housing market, some economics department who specific is looking for a housing economist will find your profile very attractive. On the other hand, consulting is more interested in the way you think, the interesting econometric method/modeling you used, and how you explain your JMP. With that being said, if a certain consulting company has a concentration of cases with a specific industry, and your JMP happens to be in this industry, then you certainly will have an edge. However, this is so hard to plan (and know this kind of information),and I generally don't think it's worth planning. In addition, if your JMP heavily cites one of their affiliated external expert, then you will likely have an advantage.
6. The prestigeness of your program.
7. Your field. Nowadays, consulting hires from all kinds of fields, ranging from economic history to macro. The edge for being an IO economist, in my opinion is very small.
