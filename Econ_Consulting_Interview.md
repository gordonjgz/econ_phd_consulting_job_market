This guide outlines tips for economic consulting interviews, specifically tailored for Economics PhD students applying for Associate-level positions. 

**Note:** The interview format is largely uniform across firms and shares similarities with the academic job market. The process typically consists of 2–3 rounds:
1.  **HR Screening** (Some firms skip this).
2.  **First Round** (Virtual or in-person with 1–2 consultants).
3.  **Fly-out** (Final round).

Below, I discuss how to secure these interviews and provide specific tips for each stage.

### 0. How to Secure Interviews
Securing the initial interview is often the hardest step to gauge, as HR rarely discloses specific screening criteria. Based on my market experience, I believe the following factors play the largest roles (ranked by estimated importance):

1.  **Genuine Interest in the Industry:** Firms want to avoid candidates who view consulting merely as a "fallback" for academia. You don't need to claim it’s your only passion, but you must demonstrate genuine curiosity. 
    * *Actionable Tip:* Attend virtual info sessions, tailor your CV (use a "resume" format rather than a purely academic CV), and speak to alumni in the industry. A non-generic cover letter highlighting these interactions goes a long way.
2.  **Letter Writers:** If you have a letter writer who is a "name" in the consulting world (e.g., often serves as an external expert), you have a significant advantage.
3.  **Teaching Experience:** A consultant's primary job is explaining complex ideas to non-technical audiences. Candidates with lead instructor experience (not just TA grading) have an edge because it demonstrates communication skills.
4.  **Mentorship Experience:** Associates often manage Research Analysts (RAs). Evidence of mentoring undergraduates or junior students signals that you can handle the managerial aspect of the firm’s culture.
5.  **Job Market Paper (JMP) Content:** * *Methodology:* Consulting firms value *how* you think and the econometric methods you use.
    * *Relevance:* While hard to plan for, if your JMP topic aligns with a firm's specific caseload (e.g., housing econometrics for a firm with heavy real estate litigation), you have an edge.
    * *Citations:* If your paper cites one of the firm's affiliated experts, it often gets noticed.
6.  **Program Prestige:** Higher-ranked programs still carry weight.
7.  **Field of Study:** Firms hire from all fields, from Macro to Economic History. The historical advantage of being an IO (Industrial Organization) economist is, in my opinion, smaller than it used to be.

**Timing:** Most firms have a deadline on **JOE** around **Nov 1st**. Even if a firm lists a later deadline (e.g., Dec 1st), **apply early**. The willingness to secure an offer before the AEA meeting is a strong signal of your commitment to the industry.

### 1. The HR Screening
While many firms skip this, if you have an HR screen, treat it as a formal interview.
* **The Goal:** Prove your communication skills. If an HR representative (who likely does not have a PhD) can understand the gist of your JMP, they will be confident putting you in front of a Partner.
* **Gather Intel:** HR often provides tips for the next rounds. Take notes—they are giving you the "cheat sheet" for their firm's culture.
* **Avoid Red Flags:** Be discreet. For example, if you are looking for a job because you didn't get a return offer from a past internship, do not disclose the "rejection" aspect to HR. Keep the narrative positive.

### 2. First Round Interview
**Format:** mostly virtual.
**Exception:** The **NABE TEC Conference** ([TEC 2025](https://www.nabe.com/NABE/NABE/Events/TEC25/TEC2025.aspx)) hosts in-person interviews for some firms. Think of TEC as the "private sector replacement" for the AEA meetings, as the AEA no longer hosts in-person interviews.
**Timing:** Usually between Thanksgiving and Christmas, though some can happen as late as February.

**Part A: The Behavioral & Research Interview**
1.  **The JMP "Spiel":** Prepare 30-second, 1-minute, and 2-minute versions of your research pitch. You won't have time to present the whole paper. Leave room for questions.
2.  **The "Grill":** Consultants are sharp economists. Be ready for deep technical questions about your data cleaning, assumptions, and econometric identification. Be candid about your paper's limitations.
3.  **The "Why" Questions:** * *Why consulting?*
    * *Why not academia/tech?* (Be honest: "I applied to academia, but consulting is my priority because [X].")
4.  **The "Jargon" Test:** You may be asked to explain technical concepts (e.g., Maximum Likelihood, Instrumental Variables) to a layperson. Practice this.
5.  **Reverse Interviewing:** Ask questions about firm culture, staffing models, or recent cases. Sending a personalized thank-you note afterward is standard etiquette; a response is usually a good sign.

**Part B: The Case Interview (Less Common)**
Fewer firms use formal case interviews now, but if they do:
1.  **Preparation:** Review the **DOJ Merger Guidelines** or the *Handbook of Antitrust* to understand the *structure* of thinking (Market Definition -> Competitive Effects -> Entry/Efficiencies).
2.  **Structure Over Weeds:** If asked to prove "A causes B," outline the strategy (e.g., "We need data on X and Y to run a regression...") rather than getting bogged down in data availability immediately.
3.  **Flexibility:** You may be asked to argue for the Plaintiff, then switch and argue for the Defendant. Do not be dogmatic. Show you can see both sides of an economic argument.
4.  **Tool Tip:** AI models are actually quite good at generating mock case interview questions for practice.

### 3. Fly-outs
Consulting fly-outs are similar to academic fly-outs: a JMP presentation + multiple 1-on-1 (sometimes 2-on-1) interviews.
**Timing:** Early round is pre-Christmas; Regular round is mid-Jan to late Feb.

**The Job Talk (Presentation)**
1.  **Length:** Usually **60 minutes** (shorter than the academic 75-90 mins). You *must* cut slides.
2.  **Polish:** Be obsessive about typos and graph clarity.
3.  **Audience:** Ensure the intuition is accessible to generalists. Do not assume everyone is in your field.
4.  **Authenticity:** Don't overhaul your JMP to make it look like a "consulting case." They know it's academic research. Authenticity and rigor are your assets here.

**Interviews & Logistics**
1.  **The "Airport Test":** Be kind to administrative staff. They are often asked for their opinion on your behavior ("Would I want to be stuck at an airport with this person?").
2.  **Junior Interviewers:** You may be interviewed by a junior Analyst. This tests your management potential. Treat them with the same respect you would a student coming to office hours.
3.  **Why You?** If you made it to the fly-out, they see something specific in you. Try to figure out what it is (e.g., your specific skill set or industry focus) and lean into it.
4.  **Scheduling:** If given a choice, pick **Tuesday or Wednesday** (when more senior staff are in the office).
5.  **Lunch:** This is a "culture fit" test. Keep conversation semi-casual (work-life balance, city life) but professional. When ordering, match the price range of your hosts.
6.  **Follow-up:** Send thank-you emails within 24 hours.

**Final Logistics Tip:** Get your flu shot. You cannot afford to be sick during fly-out season. Prepare everything in a carry-on luggage, as you cannot afford to lose your checked bag.
