### Disclaimer
> This document aims to share tips and experiences for the job market, specifically focusing on economic consulting. The goal is to provide transparency for PhD candidates seeking full-time positions in the economic and litigation consulting industry. These roles are often under-discussed in academic departments, and even supportive advisors may lack specific insights into firm differences or the interview process.

## What is Economic Consulting?
Economic consulting (often called litigation consulting) is a specialized industry that bridges the gap between law and economics. Firms primarily assist legal counsel in high-stakes litigation by analyzing complex data and quantifying damages.

Broadly, the industry is divided into several key practice areas:
1.  **Antitrust & Competition** (Mergers, price-fixing, monopolization)
2.  **Finance & Securities** (Shareholder class actions, valuation)
3.  **Healthcare & Life Sciences** (IP disputes, drug pricing)
4.  **Energy & Regulatory** (Environmental impact, rate-setting)

### The Role of a PhD
Firms hire PhD economists for their ability to perform rigorous counterfactual analysis, manage complex large-scale datasets, and—crucially—communicate sophisticated economic concepts to non-experts (judges and juries).

Most PhDs enter as **Associates** (titles vary by firm, e.g., Senior Consultant, Economist). Associates are hired with the expectation that they will grow into **Principals** or **Partners**—project managers who lead cases, attract clients, and potentially serve as testifying expert witnesses.

#### Why do firms value high-ranking PhD programs?
Since Associates are groomed to become future testifying experts, firms place a premium on the "credibility" of your degree. When an expert testifies, their academic pedigree signals authority to a judge or jury. Even if an Associate does not plan to testify, a Principal with a prestigious background finds it easier to attract clients and collaborate with external academic affiliates.

However, unlike the academic job market—which can feel like a rigid "caste" system where Tier 1 vacancies almost exclusively go to Tier 1 graduates—economic consulting is more flexible. While ranking matters, you can effectively compete through high-quality research, strong communication skills, and interview preparation.

#### Job Security & Tenure
Another reason firms are selective is that they invest heavily in retention. Unlike the tech industry, immediate firing is less common in economic consulting. For underperforming Associates, firms often use "counseling out" or attrition (e.g., lower bonuses, no promotion) rather than abrupt termination. This risk aversion makes the initial recruitment cycle highly competitive.
*(Note: This varies by firm. For instance, Keystone Strategy operates closer to a tech model and may have higher turnover for underperformance.)*

## Interview Tips
Interviews for economic consulting are fairly uniform across firms and share similarities with academic fly-outs, meaning the marginal cost of preparing for additional firms is low.

**TL;DR:**
* **Pick a Lane:** Avoid trying to be a "jack of all trades."
* **Be Authentic:** Be truthful about your research interests, even if they don't align with the firm's cases. Consultants are often "case-fatigued" and enjoy discussing novel, unrelated economic topics during the job talk.
* **Know the Industry:** Demonstrate that you understand what the job actually entails (supporting experts, data work, report writing) vs. what you *think* it entails (pure academic research).
